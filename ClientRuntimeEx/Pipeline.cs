    // and then call Pipeline's Do method passing a context, the request, and a method-specific Factory (or nil). Passing a
    // method-specific Factory allows this one call to Do to inject a Policy into the linked-list. The policy is injected where
    // the MethodFactoryMarker (see the pipeline.MethodFactoryMarker function) is in the slice of Factory objects.

    // (via the HTTPSender object passed to NewPipeline) and the response is returned backwards through all the Policy objects.
