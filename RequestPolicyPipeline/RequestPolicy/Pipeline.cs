    // The Pipeline interface represents an ordered list of Factory objects and an object implementing the HTTPSender interface.
    // You construct a Pipeline by calling the pipeline.NewPipeline function. To send an HTTP request, call pipeline.NewRequest
    // and then call Pipeline's Do method passing a context, the request, and a method-specific Factory (or nil). Passing a
    // method-specific Factory allows this one call to Do to inject a Policy into the linked-list. The policy is injected where
    // the MethodFactoryMarker (see the pipeline.MethodFactoryMarker function) is in the slice of Factory objects.
    //
    // When Do is called, the Pipeline object asks each Factory object to construct its Policy object and adds each Policy to a linked-list.
    // THen, Do sends the Context and Request through all the Policy objects. The final Policy object sends the request over the network
    // (via the HTTPSender object passed to NewPipeline) and the response is returned backwards through all the Policy objects.
    // Since Pipeline and Factory objects are immutable, you typically create 1 Pipeline object and reuse it to make many HTTP requests.
